        • BJJ is a grappling-based martial art whose central theme is the skill
        of controlling a resisting opponent in ways that force them to submit.
        BJJ does not feature kicking or punching. Techniques of BJJ are centered
        round the skill of taking an opponent down to the ground and wrestling
        for dominant control positions from where the opponent can be rendered
        harmless.


        • BJJ teaches one to defend themselves especially with opponents who
        might be bigger or stronger. This is done by utilizing superior
        leverage, grip and position upon your opponent.


        • Students benefit from greatly increased physical fitness,
        problem-solving ability, self-knowledge of their body and mind and the
        many social benefits of working and growing with your classmates.

        • Judo is a tremendous and dynamic combat sport that demands both
        physical prowess and great mental discipline. From a standing position,
        it involves techniques that allow you to lift and throw your opponents
        onto their backs.


        • JJudo does not involve kicking, punching, or striking techniques of
        any kind.


        • JInstead, judo simply involves two individuals who, by gripping the
        judo uniform, use the forces of balance, power, and movement to attempt
        to subdue each other. Thus,it is simple and basic. however, judo
        techniques often take considerable time, effort, and energy


        • JJudo is offered to Ages 5 to 7 only

        • A highly-effective self-defense martial art. Contrary to the popular
        belief, Muay Thai is not the same as kickboxing. The two are often
        mistaken for one another, which is a common misconception. Although
        there are significant similarities between them, the key difference is
        that Muay Thai allows the use of elbows.


        • Almost all Muay Thai movements involve rotating your hip with each
        kick, kicks below the waist are allowed, as well as grabbing your
        opponent’s leg mid-kick.


        • Compared to regular boxing, which uses two contact points (two fists)
        or kickboxing (four points of contact), Muay Thai fighting style uses
        eight points of contact, utilizing every part of the body in both attack
        and defense mode.

        • Yoga for functional training. You will learn to move in ways that will
        benefit daily life, not just your next yoga class. Our system takes the
        traditional practice and couples it with hard sciences like physiology,
        kinesiology, neuroscience and bio mechanics.


        • Yoga uses breathing techniques, exercise and meditation. It helps to
        improve health and happiness. Yoga increases Flexibility, Strength,

        • Kickboxing is a form of martial arts derived from karate. It borrows
        moves from multiple types of martial arts including full-contact karate,
        Muay Thai, and boxing.


        • Although the name implies kicking as a priority, this type of martial
        art uses both hands and feet as points of contact. Kicks and punches are
        both used during kickboxing.


        • Kickboxing involves lots of rapid movement and can easily increase
        your heart rate to a similar pace as running.


        •  Kickboxing often uses interval training, where participants exercise
        at peak output for 30 seconds to a couple of minutes and then rest.


        • This type of training is called high-intensity interval training and
        has been shown to be especially good for burning calories and increasing
        cardiovascular fitness.

        • Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is THE BEST non-violent self defense for children
        and teens. Our toddlers learn takedowns, throws, falling, controls. In
        the day-to-day classes, we take the punching/kicking element out of the
        equation and focus mainly on grappling. Through demonstration, students
        learn a series of techniques each day.


        • In Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes, children will meet many new friends
        and share common experiences like drilling techniques, playing games,
        and live rolling.


        • Classes begin at ages 3-4
